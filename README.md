 What is the Water Cycle?

The **water cycle** (also known as the hydrologic cycle) is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below Earth's surface. This interactive diagram helps students understand the 4 fundamental stages:

1. **Evaporation** - Water from oceans, lakes, and rivers turns into water vapor when heated by the sun
2. **Condensation** - Water vapor cools and changes back into liquid water droplets, forming clouds
3. **Precipitation** - Water falls from clouds as rain, snow, sleet, or hail
4. **Collection** - Water flows back into oceans, lakes, and rivers, completing the cycle
